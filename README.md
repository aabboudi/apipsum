**APIpsum** is a RESTful API that generates JSON objects based on a provided schema. The API offers two primary endpoints: a GET request to verify availability and a POST request to generate data. It is built with [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/), a fast, lightweight web framework written in [Go](https://go.dev/).

Contributions welcome!

## Endpoints
Will be available when the project is deployed.
